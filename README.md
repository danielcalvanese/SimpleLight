# SimpleLight
An application that controls the brightness and temperature of all connected monitors using keyboard shortcuts.  

# Installation
Put the executable anywhere and run it.  Don't move it if you have it set to run on startup.  You can download the x86 32-bit version under the executables folder that should work for everyone, or you can download the source code and compile it yourself.  

# Manual
Use the standard keyboard shortcuts Alt + Page Up & Down for brightness and Shift + Alt + Page Up & Down for temperature.  Use Alt + End for reapplication of the current settings when you adjust your monitors.  Toggle run on startup for the application to start with windows.

# Why This Exists
I use computers so much that I need absolute control over the brightness and temperature of my monitors to protect my eyes.  None of the existing applications did exactly what I wanted, so I made one that did.

# What's Different
All control is manual.  Starts at full brightness and temperature when you turn it on.  
The colors do not change or reset on a schedule.  No more light blasts every morning at sunrise.  
Modifications at high brightness and high temperature change at a faster rate than at low brightness and low temperature.  Easy to control while not pressing the button too many times.  
No complex mechanisms that use cpu cycles or memory.  
Uses the unlicense.  Take it anywhere!
